# ExperimentsBrekTheBuild
In this Unreal project I'm testing and implementing some game features that we need for the main programming project of the first semester.
The things that I've worked on in this project are:
- The monster AI
- The vision mode with the post render effects and the invisible objects
- Implementing breakable objects
- Pick objects that implement physics mechanics
- Mechanic that checks the object that you are holding and opens/closes the corresponding doors depending on it.
